# Vector Fields

This project started with an exploration into perlin noise-generated flow fields in Processing, inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY). I decided to see if I could write it in Rust so I researched graphics libraries and decided to use [nannou](https://nannou.cc). 
I plan to use the program output as a desktop background on my Gentoo machine. I haven't heard of anyone doing this so far, but I'm sure it's possible and I'll find a way if need be. I'm posting it here so other people can use it if they want to, and because I've been working on it offline for a while and I want my GitHub chart to be green.
